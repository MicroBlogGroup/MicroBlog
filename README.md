This app allows users to post thoughts and view other user thoughts similar to a twitter like application. The application is built with jQuery, SASS, html, CSS, and collaboratively designed with bootstrap. Students at the Iron Yard school were assigned to this project to practice using fetch, API handling, fetch promises, JSON files and using name space. Created a gitHub group to practice working together as a team creating branches, merging pushing and pulling.   

The backend was was build by Iron Yard instructor Jordan Kasper, and front end created by Elizabeth Boles, Seth Brady and Ryan Cronin.
